I was surprised to see this club have a whopping 55000 capacity stadium to begin with. It is a big stadium for a club all the way in Indonesia's top league but it seems like they have a very big legacy.

It was founded in 1927 and based on Surabaya, East Java which is Indonesia's second largest city.

It is regarded as part of the "Big Four" in Indonesian football along with Persija Jakarta, Persib Bandung, and Arema FC. They've won multiple national league titles (pre-1994 Perserikatan era and later Liga Indonesia), Liga 2 (2017), and various cups. Known for competitive mid-to-upper table finishes in Liga 1.

Their fans sort of scare me a bit. The group name is called Bonek which is short for Bondo Nekat(crazy steel). One of Asia's most dedicated ultra groups that travel in huge numbers but known for occasional violence. Hence my scared feeling.

One of their biggest rivalry is the Super East Java Derby with Arema FC. It has a bit of tragic back story with the 2022 Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster which had 125+ deaths after a Persebaya win. I don't think I'd see a repeat given this is just the Football Manager game. Fingers crossed 😅
