Being deep in the trenches with not many world beaters is what unemployed saves tend to be like. It's all about finding the people that will start the revolution in this small country.

My coaching revolution is already on the way with me starting up a coaching course immediately after joining:

Honestly when I first joined this team I went through only one friendly which was a 1-0 win. Not exactly awe inspiring. So we needed players.

The interesting thing about the rules in the Indonesian Super League is that we are allowed 11 FREAKING FOREIGN PLAYERS. That is so much more than I am used to given the highest I had at a non European club was 8 in Saudi Arabia. Thankfully the core foreigners in the club were good enough to have a decent charge in the league and cup. But the main thing I could notice was no quality in the full back positions(If anybody somehow read my time in India 2 Manchester you'd remember how frustrated I got not seeing any good Indian full backs 😂) but thankfully I still had some foreign slots to fill and I managed to fill them. Here's who I brought in after some trials, scouting and many more:

He is really one of these can play anywhere kind of player which I am a fan of. And he suits the system I am planning with this team honestly. More on that after talking about the other signings.

Maybe I could've done better for a LWB but I needed somebody immediately and he seemed like the best option I could have gotten.

A really good pick up in all honesty. My only worry is the fact that he is 36. I hope he can hold onto the decent physical attributes and the high marking and passing.

Only a backup but given I was going to not waste a foreign slot on a backup I needed someone decent if my first choice keeper was injured. The interesting thing was that the Super League HAS to have a minimum of 3 keepers.

Not exactly a world beater I know but I did need a good Indonesian player who would be the 3rd capable center back in my system. And yes this gives me away that I am going for another version of the 3 back system 😅. I love the flexibility it offers and it would give us solidity. Sue me.

Someone who can be a capable backup when called upon. Given I had an injury to one of the backups I had for the front line, I needed someone to be next to him. So I hope he can deliver whenever required.

So after doing the signings we made a jump from 50-1 which was tied with so many other teams in the top half/mid table which was always nice to see:

Arema FC our rivals are slated to finish ahead of us which is kind of annoying so I hope we can buck these odds.

We are nearing the start of the season and we do face Arema FC in our second match and the start of the season looks like it could be a good start

PSIM are newly promoted and Persijap and Borneo FC are bottom level teams. So here's hoping the system really works.

Speaking of the system, given I need to be cautious while I start out given the expectation of this season but something that I hope will be strong where it matters.
