This was done when I was testing the database strength so technically I'm still 25 since I started it in the Indonesian pre season at the moment.

But either way WE. ARE. BACK.....in the job center 😅. With no badges and playing career to fall back on like the news article suggests I am keeping an eye on jobs in Indonesia and Malaysia and I noticed some open ones which I immediately applied for:

Out of the ones I applied 2 were from the 2nd division of Indonesian football which were PSIS and Persela. And the other 2 were from Indonesia's top division. One was relegation candidates in Persijap and the other were fairly decent mid-table club Persebaya. Their manager had left for another team in the same league and when I checked their club info I was shocked. Take a look:

A mid table club with a 55000 capacity stadium. Unbelievable. I never thought I'd get a chance but after a while I did get the chance:

Wow. A mid level Indonesian club actually wants me. And I will be managing in a 55000 stadium in a freaking TRACKSUIT with no coaching badges. Unbelievable. But I wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth so I decided to take it with both hands:

For a reminder this is my manager profile at the moment. Keep in mind this was the same language profile I had for my India to Manchester save game so a word of warning 😅

This is what I have to fix with my coaching badges.

## The hard work begins now. Let's assess the squad we have and plan the first signing and beyond
