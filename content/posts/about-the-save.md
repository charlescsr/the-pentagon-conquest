An unemployed save often intrigues everyone and it does intrigue me after I started with no coaching badges twice.

Once was just unemployed to see if I can make it to United.

The second time was a typical journeyman save moving from India to Manchester.

So this next challenge I will be taking up is probably one of the biggest AND hardest to do in Football Manager.

This is another journey from unemployed to the topmost coaching badges but with an extra kicker: Winning the top continental competitions in 5 continents: AFC, CAF, CONMEBOL and CONCACAF. Football fans usually only pay attention to the UEFA Champions League as the main competition but that is only for clubs in Europe. What about the other continents?

## That's where this challenge comes in

Including the UEFA Champions League there are 4 other top continental competitions in other continents. They are:

- The AFC Champions League Elite in Asia

- The CAF Champions League in Africa

- The Copa Libertadores in South America

- The CONCACAF Champions Cup in North America

This is labeled as one of the hardest challenges in Football Manager for a reason. Mainly because you start unemployed without any coaching badges or past experience. And any external editors or tools will be disabled along with attribute masking which means you won't be able to see all the exact attribute values of other players until you scout them fully. And all the trophies should be won in one entire save game. This is a grueling journey of building your reputation and knowing when to take the next step up to push for each of these 5 trophies. And given I often have the editor in case of emergency, this will be a big test in general really.

Right now these are the leagues I'm looking to add for each continent:

### Asia

The main leagues that will help in the AFC CL push are namely Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan and for an outside shot China. Qatar and U.A.E are also good options just to either build reputation and move forward with my career. There will be Iran added in too due to the reputation of the clubs there.

I am planning to start with the likes of Indonesia and Malaysia in hopes to get my foot in the door and I will try to push upwards whenever any job opens up once I build my reputation with league titles and coaching badges.

### Africa

For the CAF CL, the main leagues I am aiming to target are South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. D.R Congo is a league to build reputation but only in a "Break glass in case of emergency" option really.

### North America

Mexico is included in the base game itself and I have added U.S.A which are the best options really for the CONCACAF Champions Cup

### South America

Given the main trophy is the Copa Libertadores, Argentina and Brazil are definitely the places to aim for. Leagues from Africa onwards will mostly aim to be the top division only. European nations will definitely be just the top leagues only.

### Europe

This is fairly straightforward with adding the big leagues like England, Spain, Germany and Italy. France is just added in there in case there is the off chance of being hired by PSG. That's all

## This is going to be a struggle and a drag all in one and a test of my patience if things don't click. Let's see what happens
