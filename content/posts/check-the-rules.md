This should be my reminder to always always ALWAYS look at the rules of each tournament before making the signings. Because I got caught not only in the league rules but also the rules for the Indonesian Cup.

The rules that are followed in the Indonesian Super League are as follows:

I did mess it up because you can only have up to 9 foreign players in the entire squad and that's why the squad had initially 9 to begin with when I joined the club(I don't have my badges yet sue me 😅).

But the rules for the cup were so much more stricter:

Given everything that was set up I had to rely on some decent enough youth prospects and I honestly blame the rules for us needing extra time to beat the second division opposition in the first ever round.

We are looking good in the league still somehow staying unbeaten despite everything:

Some notable results along the way were as follows:

An annoying draw against arch rivals Arema but honestly we were still fairly poor in the beginning of the season so given the flow of the match we did well to rescue the draw.

Another one was a big win against our other rival in Persib which was fairly dominant

Then there was the first round in the Indonesian Cup against the second division which needed an extra time winner from one of our youth strikers who I brought as a gamble after we were heavily dominant after we conceded.

And from what you would have seen in the league table, the winner of the league only gets qualification to the AFC Champions League Two which is not the continental competition I am aiming for. That is the AFC Champions League Elite. I thought maybe being present in that competition might be good reputation building but I made one TINY oversight. Take a look:

Seems like the Saudi clubs are still involved here. When I checked the Saudi League the top two go into the AFC CL Elite and the third placed team is the one that gets dumped here and that seemed to be Al-Nassr. So while showing up here would be helpful, you can't really expect to win it really given the quality of teams present.

A signing I am happy to bring in for the second transfer window is actually Indonesian and a fairly well rated striker:

I was desperately searching so much to bring somebody who can be Indonesian and good quality and I found him when looking through the national team. Another pleasant surprise I found was sort of a FM career legend of mine:

For context, the very first unemployed to glory save game I did I brought this guy in when I was in the Netherlands with sc Heerenveen. He was Dutch back then and now I learned he actually reps Indonesia which apparently was his descent and heritage and he was officially sworn in as a Indonesian player and now he is part of their squad.

We have a lot of work to do to keep our run going and unexpected title challenge alive too given we were predicted to finish 4th. 

## Let's keep pushing
